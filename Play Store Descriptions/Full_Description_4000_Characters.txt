FULL DESCRIPTION:
🚖 TAXI - Real-Time Visibility for SA Taxi Ranks

See what's coming before it arrives. Walk to your usual taxi pickup point, open TAXI, and get real-time visibility of taxis and passengers going your way.

📍 THE SIMPLE SCENARIO

You need to go to town. As you walk to your usual taxi pickup spot, you open TAXI:

1. Select "Passenger" 
2. Select "TOWN"
3. Map shows ONLY taxis going to town in real-time

Now as you wait at the pickup point, you can see exactly where the town taxis are. Is one 5 minutes away? 10 minutes? You know what's coming. Other passengers going to town also appear on the map.

Since you're on the map now, drivers can see you waiting at the pickup point. A driver sees passengers at the rank and knows there's business waiting. Everyone wins.

Same for drivers - select "Driver", select "TOWN", see all passengers waiting at pickup points who want to go to town.
